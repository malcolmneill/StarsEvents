## Udacity project description 
>You will build a responsive web application that allows the user to establish a meet-up event. The goal is to create an app that is a joy to use on both desktop and mobile. The application must allow someone to name their event, search for a host location (using a location API like Foursquare), set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event.

## How to use

1. Open index.html in `src/` or `/dist` to run the app.
2. first you will see a registration form, you can fill the form to register or skip, either way you could use the app.
3. After you register or close the registration form, you could fill in the form in the `add` pane to add an event.
  * In the add event form, the `event name`, `event type`, `start time` and `location` is required.
  * You can choose a color for a event, this event's card's background-color will be the color of your choose.
4. All your event will show up in `My events` pane.
5. you could always click the `register` button on the top right to register.
